# Socrateach 🧠💬  
*An AI-Powered Socratic Tutor that Teaches Through Questions, Not Answers*

## Overview

**Socrateach** is an intelligent tutoring platform based on the **Socratic method**—a form of cooperative dialogue where the teacher stimulates critical thinking through thought-provoking questions.

Instead of giving direct answers, **Socrateach** asks users a series of questions to guide them toward discovering the answers themselves. It evaluates user responses and adapts follow-up questions accordingly, creating a personalized, exploratory learning journey.
